  - <i>Huff... Puff...</i> I just had to fight a reanimated magic armor. It was <b>super</b>
    tough.
  - Did that affect you guys out there? Oh now everyone has <b>armor?</b>
  - If armor works like it did in here, it'll <b>block damage equal to the strength
    of the armor.</b>
  - The strength of <b>armor will then degrade by one every time it's hit.</b>
  - Even if they have a tonne of armor though, you'll <b>always deal at least 1 damage.</b>
  - I'm as naked as the day I ate my way out of my mother's womb, killing her in
    the process...
  - And you guys all got armor to wear... Rediculous!
