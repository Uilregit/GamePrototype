  - MONSIEUR FLUFFYBUTT!
  - <b>I</b>, Nero <i>the All Powerful</i>, need your help...
  - Now I <i>know</i> we've had our differences.
  - You didn' want to be turned into a corgi, and I didn't want to hear you talk
    about it.
  - But someone messed with the <b>Deckronomicon</b> and ripped out most of the pages.
  - Monsters inscribed on those pages aren't bound by the book anymore, they're running
    free!
  - They're the <b>Undecked</b>!
  - Also I'm trapped in the <b>Deckronomicon</b> so I can't turn you back.
  - 'Unless... '
  - You kill the <b>Undecked</b> and return them to the <b> Deckronomicon</b>.
  - Go forth! <i>Deck</i> them in the face like Nero <i>the Pacifist</i> showed you
    how!
