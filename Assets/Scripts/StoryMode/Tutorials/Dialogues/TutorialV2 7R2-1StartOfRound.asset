  - '<b>Your health does not heal between rounds.</b> '
  - If any of your health falls to 0, that person is out. If you're all out, you're
    done.
  - Cards on the table, me smash things in here isn't working great and I don't have
    backups for you guys...
  - So not that y'alls were thrilled about dying before, but, you know, heal up.
